\section{Frequency Modulation}

As we have previously discussed, we want our frequency modulation input as a combination
of a manual voltage (using a knob) and an arbitrary control voltage from the outside.

We will also add a clipper to prevent unwanted voltages in the exponential converter.

Also, components values will be better explained further in the manual.

This is what we want to achieve:
